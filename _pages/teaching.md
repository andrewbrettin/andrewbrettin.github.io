## Teaching statement

I am committed to fostering a learning environment that supports a diversity of perspectives and experiences and respects students’ individual identities. All students should feel free to share their thoughts in the classroom—regardless of race, class, gender, sexuality, religion, political orientation, ability, or other identity/status.

Resources:
* [NYU’s Office of Equal Opportunity](https://www.nyu.edu/about/leadership-university-administration/office-of-the-president/chief-of-staff/equal-opportunity.html): promotes diversity and equal opportunity and enforces NYU’s non-discrimination and anti-harassment policies.
  - [Non-discrimination and anti-harassment](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/equal-opportunity/harassment-and-discrimination.html) Discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is federally prohibited at universities like NYU by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VI.
  - [Title IX](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/equal-opportunity/title9.html): Title IX protects individuals from sex or gender based discrimination, harassment, and bullying, and protects individuals from retaliation from filing complaints of discrimination or harassment. 
* [Religious observances](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/university-calendar-policy-on-religious-holidays.html): NYU permits religious exemptions when required for compliance with students’ religious obligations.
* Moses Center for Student Accessibility: The [Moses Center for Student Accessibility] (https://www.nyu.edu/about/leadership-university-administration/office-of-the-president/office-of-the-provost/university-life/office-of-studentaffairs/student-health-center/moses-center-for-student-accessibility.html) (CSA) provides accommodations and services for students with accessibility needs.
* Counseling and Wellness Services (CWS): As a student, you may experience personal challenges, like stress, anxiety, depression, and more. NYU offers virtual and in-person [counseling services](https://www.nyu.edu/students/health-and-wellness/services/counseling-services.html) for free to students. 
* FERPA: Under federal law, students have several privacy rights regarding their educational records. These are codified in the [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/FERPA.html).
