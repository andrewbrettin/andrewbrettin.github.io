I am a graduating PhD student at the [Center for Atmosphere-Ocean Science](https://caos.cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) (CAOS) 
at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) at New York University.
My advisor is [Laure Zanna](https://zanna-researchteam.github.io/author/laure-zanna/).

My research focuses on understanding sea level variability on timescales ranging from the hourly to the seasonal. In particular, 
I seek to identify sources of predictability and quantify uncertainties associated with sea level variability using data-driven techniques
(especially those which incorporate dynamical representations or permit probabilistic interpretation).
I'm an affiliate of [M2LInES](https://m2lines.github.io/)
and am supported by the [VoLo Foundation](https://volofoundation.org/project/new-york-university-nyu/).
