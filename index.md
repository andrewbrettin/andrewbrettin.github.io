I am a fourth year PhD student at the [Center for Atmosphere-Ocean Science](https://caos.cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) (CAOS) 
at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) at New York University.
My advisor is [Laure Zanna](https://laurezanna.github.io).

My research aims to constrain estimates for future sea level extremes under changing atmospheric forcing
variability due to climate change. I mainly rely on data-driven methods at the intersection of probability, classical statistics, 
computing, and machine learning to build understanding about sea level and climate. I'm an affiliate of [M2LInES](https://m2lines.github.io/)
and am supported by the [VoLo Foundation](https://volofoundation.org/project/new-york-university-nyu/).

I'm a Wisconsinite, a marathoner, an amateur piano player, and an avid Mets supporter (though perhaps not as much of a baseball fanatic as my advisor)!
